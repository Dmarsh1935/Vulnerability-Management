# Vulnerability Management in Azure using OpenVAS

## Introduction

In this project, I setup a vulnerability management scanner by installing OpenVAS from the Azure marketplace. Once setup, I created a Windows 10 client VM and intentionally made it vulnerable by disabling the firewall and installing outdated versions of software like Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader. Once the client VM was vulnerable, I configured OpenVAS to perform both an unauthenticated and credentialed scan against the Windows 10 VM to view the results.

As you can see, the vulnerable software installed earlier did not appear in the results of this scan due to it being unauthenticated. To perform a credentialed scan, I created new credentials in OpenVAS and cloned the previous target. I then executed the credentialed scan against the vulnerable VM using these new credentials. Although this scan takes longer, it provides a more thorough analysis of vulnerabilities.

With a credentialed scan, our findings are significantly different. This scan reveals the vulnerable applications we installed and uncovers many more vulnerabilities than the unauthenticated scan. In terms of severity, the credentialed scan identified the highest possible ratings. Next, I will remediate these issues, run another credentialed scan, and present the updated results.

## Conclusion

In this project, a mini honeynet was constructed in Microsoft Azure and log sources were integrated into a Log Analytics workspace. Microsoft Sentinel was employed to trigger alerts and create incidents based on the ingested logs. Additionally, metrics were measured in the insecure environment before security controls were applied, and then again after implementing security measures. It is noteworthy that the number of security events and incidents were drastically reduced after the security controls were applied, demonstrating their effectiveness.

It is worth noting that if the resources within the network were heavily utilized by regular users, it is likely that more security events and alerts may have been generated within the 24-hour period following the implementation of the security controls.
