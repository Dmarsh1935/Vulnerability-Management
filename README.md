# Vulnerability Management in Azure using OpenVAS

## Introduction

In this project, I setup a vulnerability management scanner by installing OpenVAS from the Azure marketplace. Once setup, I created a Windows 10 client VM and intentionally made it vulnerable by disabling the firewall and installing outdated versions of software like Firefox, VLC Player, and Adobe Reader. Once the client VM was vulnerable, I configured OpenVAS to perform both an unauthenticated and credentialed scan against the Windows 10 VM to view the results.

As you can see, the vulnerable software installed earlier did not appear in the results of this scan due to it being unauthenticated. To perform a credentialed scan, I created new credentials in OpenVAS and cloned the previous target. I then executed the credentialed scan against the vulnerable VM using these new credentials. Although this scan takes longer, it provides a more thorough analysis of vulnerabilities.

With a credentialed scan, our findings are significantly different. This scan reveals the vulnerable applications we installed and uncovers many more vulnerabilities than the unauthenticated scan. In terms of severity, the credentialed scan identified the highest possible ratings. Next, I will remediate some of these by uninstalling the outdated software, run another credentialed scan, and present the updated results.

You can see that the trend is going down and the vulnerable software is no longer in the results. Although the severity rating is still very high, we can investigate the scans findings and remediate the vulnerabilities further. 




## Conclusion

In this project, I used Azure to create an OpenVAS vulnerability management server. I also created a Windows 10 VM and intentionally made it vulnerable by disabling the firewall and installing outdated versions of Adobe Reader, Firefox, and VLC Player. I ran an unauthenticated scan with OpenVAS and analyzed the results. I then performed a credentialed scan and observed significant differences in the findings. After uninstalling the outdated software, I ran another credentialed scan, which showed a reduction in vulnerabilities.
